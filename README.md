Project Description

Movie Buddy matches users with others to watch upcoming films in order to meet new people and help engage or even create a local film community.

Problem statement

Often times one wants to see a movie, but their friends are either unavailable or have already seen it. This means that people are forced to go to the movies alone or not go at all.

How will your project solve this problem?

No more lonely nights! Movie Buddy is here, so you do not have to go to the movies alone!
Movie Buddy will provide a solution by matching people that want to see the same movie. People are given a list of movies in theaters to add to their wishlist. People can connect with others who share the same movie selections.

Map the user experience

The users will log-in or create a profile that contains a wishlist for movies they want to see. Movie Buddy will populate a list of users that want to see the same movies.

- User creates a profile that keeps track of their movie preferences
- User is given a list of others who want to see the same the movie
- User can edit their wishlist by deleting or adding movies

What technologies do you plan to use?

React will be our front end framework.  Weâ€™ll use Express, Knex, and PostgreSQL for our database.  Auth0 is the library for our user authentication.
